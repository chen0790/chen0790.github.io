        <p>I started to practice<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis" target="_blank">Table Tennis</a> when I was 6 years old. My father wanted me to have a skill and practice the same sports that are good for the body. I became a Chinese national second-level athlete when I was 12 years old. Become a national level athlete. Later, at the age of 18, he came to Canada.
